        Campaign contributions, especially "soft money" to political action committees or political parties, have become increasingly important in American politics. To add to that, the Supreme Court recently ruled that corporations can spend unlimited money on political campaigns using so-called Super PACs. With all these complicated campaign finance laws, it's hard to tell what company supports which cause. Buy Back Your Vote helps you see those relationships clearly. This app shows what percentage of each company's political contributions goes towards which candidates, political parties, and PACs, and what laws and bills in Congress they support or oppose.
